  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Model size'. Diagram: Three model blocks labeled 'small', 'medium', 'large' with a latency arrow increasing from small to large. Use a simple 'latency' arrow label. Only text: 'Model size', 'small', 'medium', 'large', 'latency'.",

    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Model size'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Model sizes are clearly labeled.",
    "Latency increases with size."

    "improvements": [
      "To push the deadpan humor more, you could slightly exaggerate the relative block sizes or arrow length while keeping the same labels and style.",
      "Ensure the title alignment is precisely at the very top-left margin for strict consistency with other slides in the same deck."

    "summary": "All rubric items are satisfied: clean technical vector style, correct title 'Model size', only specified text present, model sizes clearly labeled, and the latency arrow increases from small to large."
