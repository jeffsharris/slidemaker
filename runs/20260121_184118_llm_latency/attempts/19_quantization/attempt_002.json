  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Quantization'. Diagram: A stack of numeric blocks labeled '16-bit', '8-bit', '4-bit' with a speed arrow. Only text: 'Quantization', '16-bit', '8-bit', '4-bit'. Refinements: Remove the small grid/rectangular glyphs inside the 16-bit block so that the only visible text/markings are the labels 'Quantization', '16-bit', '8-bit', '4-bit'.; Keep the existing clean vector, muted color palette, stacked blocks, and speed arrow, which already satisfy the style, title, precision levels, and implied speed increase requirements..",
