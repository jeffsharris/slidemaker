Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Congestion'. Diagram: Multiple request strips entering a single service lane, forming a visible queue. A clock icon shows delay. Only text: 'Congestion'.",

    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",

    "improvements": [
      "Lean slightly harder into the deadpan humor by adding a subtly exaggerated detail (e.g., an overfilled last queue cell) while keeping it non-textual and technical.",

The slide passes fully."
