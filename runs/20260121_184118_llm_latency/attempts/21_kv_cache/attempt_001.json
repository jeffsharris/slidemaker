  "prompt": "Playful, cute vector illustration with rounded shapes and soft shadows, pastel palette (mint, coral, sky blue, sunny yellow) on off-white background. Big central illustration, minimal text. Title text in top-left: 'KV cache'. No logos or brand names. Memory blocks with reuse arrows; a dimmed eviction block. Label 'reuse'.",

      "Cache reuse is shown via arrows, but you could make the reuse loop even more explicit by forming a closed circular path among the colorful blocks or adding a subtle \"loop\" icon.",
      "Eviction is nicely de-emphasized with the dim gray block; you could further downplay it by reducing its size slightly or softening the surrounding sparkles so it competes less with the main colorful blocks."

    "summary": "All rubric items are met: cache reuse is clearly depicted with arrows between colorful memory blocks, eviction is visually de-emphasized using a dim gray sad block, the title 'KV cache' is clearly visible in the top-left, and the style is playful, minimal, and pastel. Only minor tweaks are possible to further highlight reuse and downplay eviction."
