  "prompt": "Playful, cute vector illustration with rounded shapes and soft shadows, pastel palette (mint, coral, sky blue, sunny yellow) on off-white background. Big central illustration, minimal text. Title text in top-left: 'Size'. No logos or brand names. Three model blocks increasing in size with a speed gauge decreasing. Labels: 'small', 'medium', 'large'.",
  "rubric": [
    "Model sizes are clearly shown.",
    "Larger size implies slower speed.",
    "Title 'Size' is visible.",
    "Playful, minimal style."

    "improvements": [
      "To emphasize the speed relationship even more, you could add subtle numeric or text cues (e.g., 'fast', 'medium', 'slow') near the gauge and align it more clearly with each block size.",
      "Consider slightly thickening the labels 'small', 'medium', 'large' or increasing contrast to improve readability from a distance."
    ],
    "summary": "All rubric items are met: the three model blocks clearly increase in size and are labeled small/medium/large; the speed gauge points to higher speed near the smallest block area, visually implying larger size is slower; the title 'Size' is clearly visible in the top-left; and the overall design is playful, minimal, and matches the requested pastel, rounded vector style."
