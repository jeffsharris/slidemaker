  "prompt": "Playful, cute vector illustration with rounded shapes and soft shadows, pastel palette (mint, coral, sky blue, sunny yellow) on off-white background. Big central illustration, minimal text. Title text in top-left: 'Quantize'. No logos or brand names. A chip with a bit ladder: 16-bit -> 8-bit -> 4-bit, and a speed arrow increasing.",
  "rubric": [
    "Lower precision steps are shown.",
    "Speed increase is implied.",
    "Title 'Quantize' is visible.",
    "Playful style."

  "grade": {
    "pass": true,
    "score": 1.0,
    "failures": [],
    "improvements": [
      "Clarify the directionality of the precision ladder by adding a subtle down arrow or label like 'lower precision' from 16-bit to 4-bit so the reduction is explicitly communicated.",
      "Reinforce the speed concept by adding a small speed-related icon or label (e.g., a stopwatch or the word 'faster') near the rising arrow to remove any ambiguity about what is increasing.",
      "Increase the prominence of the title 'Quantize' slightly (size or contrast) so it stands out more as a slide title in presentation contexts."
    ],
    "summary": "All rubric items are met: the 16-bit \u2192 8-bit \u2192 4-bit ladder clearly shows lower precision steps, the large rising arrow behind the chip implies speed increase, the word 'Quantize' is visible at the top-left, and the overall illustration is playful, cute, and pastel. Only minor clarifications could make the message even more explicit."
