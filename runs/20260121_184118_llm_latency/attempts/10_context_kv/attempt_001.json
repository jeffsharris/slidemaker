      "Context growth is shown well by the elongated multi-car trailer; you could exaggerate the stretching effect (e.g., ghosted shorter trailer behind it) to make the idea of \u2018growing\u2019 even clearer.",
      "KV cache / memory growth is implied by the stacking disks; to emphasize memory pressure, consider adding a subtle strain cue (e.g., small sweat drop on the car or trailer, or tiny warning icon near the tallest stack).",
      "Playful minimal style and palette are strong; to push minimalism further, you could slightly reduce the amount of ground detail (fewer flowers/grass tufts) to keep more focus on the trailer and memory stack."
    ],
    "summary": "All rubric items are met: context growth is visualized by a lengthening KV trailer, KV/memory growth is implied by increasing disk stacks with arrows, the title 'Context' is clearly visible in the top-left, and the illustration is playful, cute, and minimal in style using a pastel palette. Minor tweaks could make the growth and memory-pressure concepts even more explicit."
