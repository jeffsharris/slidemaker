  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'What makes it slow?'. Diagram: A signpost pointing to a schematic request conveyor with token pills, and a small warning triangle. Only text: 'What makes it slow?'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'What makes it slow?'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "The slide clearly reads as a section opener."
  ],
  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.6,
    "failures": [
      "Extra text beyond the specified labels appears: 'REQUESTS' and 'SLOW PROCESS' on the signpost, and an exclamation-mark icon on the warning triangle instead of being text-free.",
      "The warning triangle is not small relative to the rest of the diagram; it is fairly prominent under the machine.",
      "Prompt requested 'Only text: \"What makes it slow?\"', but additional words are present on the slide."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Remove all text except the title 'What makes it slow?'. The signpost and any icons (including the warning triangle) should be purely graphical with no letters or symbols.",
      "Ensure the warning triangle is visually smaller and more subtle so it reads as a minor caution element rather than a dominant label.",
      "Keep the existing clean technical vector style, subtle shadows, and layout, as these already satisfy the deadpan corporate look and section-opener feel."
    ],
    "summary": "The visual style and section-opener feel are strong, but the slide fails the strict text constraint by including extra labels and symbols beyond the required title, and the warning triangle is not particularly small."
