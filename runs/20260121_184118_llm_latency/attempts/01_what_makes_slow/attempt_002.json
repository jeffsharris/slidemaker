  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'What makes it slow?'. Diagram: A signpost pointing to a schematic request conveyor with token pills, and a small warning triangle. Only text: 'What makes it slow?'. Refinements: Remove all text except the title 'What makes it slow?'. The signpost and any icons (including the warning triangle) should be purely graphical with no letters or symbols.; Ensure the warning triangle is visually smaller and more subtle so it reads as a minor caution element rather than a dominant label.; Keep the existing clean technical vector style, subtle shadows, and layout, as these already satisfy the deadpan corporate look and section-opener feel..",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'What makes it slow?'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "The slide clearly reads as a section opener."

  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.75,
    "failures": [
      "The warning triangle contains an exclamation mark, which violates the requirement that the signpost and any icons be purely graphical with no letters or symbols."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Remove the exclamation mark from the warning triangle so it becomes a purely graphical caution icon with no internal symbol.",
      "Optionally reduce the triangle\u2019s size slightly further to emphasize its minor, non-dominant caution role while keeping the existing clean technical vector style and layout."
    ],
    "summary": "The slide otherwise meets the style, title text, no-extra-text, and section-opener requirements, but it fails the strict icon specification because the warning triangle includes an exclamation mark symbol."
