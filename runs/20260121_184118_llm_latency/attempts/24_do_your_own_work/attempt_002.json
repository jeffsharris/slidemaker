  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Do the work'. Diagram: an oversized rubber stamp slams onto a simple slide icon, with a dramatic burst mark. The stamp face reads 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'. Only text: 'Do the work', 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Do the work'.",
    "The stamp face reads exactly 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "A large stamp and a slide icon are clearly visible.",
    "The composition feels intentionally over-the-top."

  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 7.0,
    "failures": [
      "The diagram uses a playground slide icon instead of a simple presentation slide icon, which does not match the requested \"simple slide icon\" metaphor.",
      "While the overall style is clean and vector-based, it leans more toward playful illustration than a strictly \"deadpan corporate technical diagram\" style."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Replace the playground slide with a minimalist presentation slide icon (e.g., a rectangle with a small title bar or content area) so the imagery aligns with the specified \"simple slide icon.\"",
      "Refine the visual style toward a more corporate technical-diagram look: simplify shapes, reduce cartoon-like exaggeration in the stamp, and use subtler motion/burst lines while keeping the over-the-top composition conceptually intact."
    ],
    "summary": "Text, placement, colors, and over-the-top composition are correct, but the icon is a playground slide rather than a presentation slide, and the style is more playful illustration than deadpan corporate technical diagram."
