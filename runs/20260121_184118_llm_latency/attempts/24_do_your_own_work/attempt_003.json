  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Do the work'. Diagram: an oversized rubber stamp slams onto a simple slide icon, with a dramatic burst mark. The stamp face reads 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'. Only text: 'Do the work', 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Do the work'.",
    "The stamp face reads exactly 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "A large stamp and a slide icon are clearly visible.",
    "The composition feels intentionally over-the-top."

  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.83,
    "failures": [
      "The diagram shows a playground slide rather than a recognizable presentation slide icon as requested.",
      "The background object being stamped is not clearly identifiable as a slide *icon*; it looks like a physical playground slide."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Redesign the stamped object to be an unmistakable presentation slide icon (e.g., a rectangle with a title bar or border, possibly on a stand) instead of a playground slide.",
      "Use more conventional slide-icon visual cues (simple rectangle, minimal perspective, maybe a small stand or frame) to make the subject clearly match the prompt."
    ],
    "summary": "Most rubric items are met: clean technical vector style with deadpan humor, correct title text 'Do the work', correct stamp text 'DO YOUR OWN WORK', no extra text, large stamp clearly visible, and an over-the-top composition. However, the object under the stamp is visually a playground slide rather than a clear slide icon, so it does not fully satisfy the requirement for a simple slide icon being stamped."
