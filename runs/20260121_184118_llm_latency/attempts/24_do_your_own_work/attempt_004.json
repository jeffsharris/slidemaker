  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Do the work'. Diagram: an oversized rubber stamp slams onto a simple slide icon, with a dramatic burst mark. The stamp face reads 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'. Only text: 'Do the work', 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Do the work'.",
    "The stamp face reads exactly 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "A large stamp and a slide icon are clearly visible.",
    "The composition feels intentionally over-the-top."
  ],
  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.83,
    "failures": [
      "The diagram shows a playground-style slide structure rather than a simple slide icon, making the iconography slightly more complex than specified.",
      "The visual style leans more illustrative/cartoon than strictly clean technical diagram, which weakens the \"deadpan corporate technical diagram\" requirement."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Simplify the slide element to a minimal slide icon (e.g., a basic rounded rectangle for a slide thumbnail or a very simple abstract slide shape) rather than a full playground slide with ladder and base.",
      "Refine the overall illustration style toward a flatter, more schematic corporate-technical look (straighter lines, fewer playful curves, more diagram-like proportions) while keeping the existing color palette and shadows.",
      "Reduce any playful visual exaggerations in the shapes themselves and express the over-the-top feel primarily through the stamp\u2019s size, angle, and impact burst to better match a deadpan corporate tone."
    ],
    "summary": "Most rubric items are met: correct title text, correct stamp text, no extra text, large stamp and target with an intentionally over-the-top impact. However, the slide icon is depicted as a playground slide rather than a simple slide icon, and the style is more illustrative than a strict deadpan corporate technical diagram, so it does not fully pass the specified rubric."
