  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Do the work'. Diagram: an oversized rubber stamp slams onto a simple slide icon, with a dramatic burst mark. The stamp face reads 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'. Only text: 'Do the work', 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Do the work'.",
    "The stamp face reads exactly 'DO YOUR OWN WORK'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "A large stamp and a slide icon are clearly visible.",
    "The composition feels intentionally over-the-top."

    "failures": [
      "The diagram shows a playground slide icon instead of a simple presentation slide icon as specified ('simple slide icon')."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Redesign the lower icon to clearly resemble a presentation slide (e.g., simple rectangle with a border/stand or a stylized slide thumbnail) rather than a playground slide.",
      "Keep the existing stamp, burst, and color treatment, but align the underlying icon more closely with common slide/presentation metaphors to better match the prompt."
    ],
    "summary": "Most rubric items are met: deadpan technical style, correct title text, correct stamp text, no extra text, large visible stamp, and over-the-top composition. However, the central icon is a playground slide instead of a simple presentation slide icon, so it does not fully satisfy the specified diagram requirement."
