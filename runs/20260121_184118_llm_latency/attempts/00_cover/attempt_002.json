      "Style matches a clean, technical, deadpan-humor diagram with vector lines, subtle shadows, and muted palette with cyan and orange accents\u2014this aligns with the prompt.",
      "Title text in the top-left reads exactly 'What matters' and is placed consistently along the top with a horizontal rule, matching expectations.",
      "No additional text or numbers appear anywhere else on the slide beyond the title; the diagram elements are purely visual.",
      "The large chat bubble with three loading dots, a visible queue of office workers holding coffee cups, and a small hourglass are all present and clearly depicted.",
      "To push closer to the prompt, the background tone and line weights could be tuned slightly more toward a stark \u2018corporate UI\u2019 aesthetic (e.g., slightly flatter shadows, more uniform stroke widths), though this is optional rather than required."
