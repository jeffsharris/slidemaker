  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Batching'. Diagram: Several request strips stacked into a single rectangular batch box feeding into a GPU block labeled 'GPU'. Show a single forward pass arrow. Only text: 'Batching', 'GPU'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Batching'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Multiple requests are stacked into one batch.",
    "The batch feeds a GPU block in one forward pass."

  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 6.0,
    "failures": [
      "Extra text 'Batch' appears inside the batch box, violating the requirement that only 'Batching' and 'GPU' appear as text.",
      "Diagram text does not strictly follow the 'only exact text specified' constraint; 'Batch' is not allowed."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Remove the word 'Batch' from inside the batch box so that the only text on the slide is the title 'Batching' and the GPU label 'GPU'.",
      "After removing the extra label, keep the stacked colored strips visually implying multiple requests forming a batch feeding into the GPU via the single forward-pass arrow; no further text changes needed."
    ],
    "summary": "The visual style, title placement, stacked requests, and single forward-pass arrow into the GPU are correct, but the slide fails because it includes unauthorized extra text ('Batch')."
