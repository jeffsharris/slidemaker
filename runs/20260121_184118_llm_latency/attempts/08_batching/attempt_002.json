  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Batching'. Diagram: Several request strips stacked into a single rectangular batch box feeding into a GPU block labeled 'GPU'. Show a single forward pass arrow. Only text: 'Batching', 'GPU'. Refinements: Remove the word 'Batch' from inside the batch box so that the only text on the slide is the title 'Batching' and the GPU label 'GPU'.; After removing the extra label, keep the stacked colored strips visually implying multiple requests forming a batch feeding into the GPU via the single forward-pass arrow; no further text changes needed..",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Batching'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Multiple requests are stacked into one batch.",
    "The batch feeds a GPU block in one forward pass."

  "grade": {
    "pass": true,

    "failures": [],
    "improvements": [
      "To emphasize deadpan corporate humor, you could make the arrow or GPU block slightly oversized or exaggerated while keeping the current clean style.",
      "Consider adding even subtler shadows or slightly more consistent spacing around the stacked strips and GPU block for an even more polished technical-diagram look."
    ],
    "summary": "All rubric items are satisfied: clean technical style, title exactly 'Batching', only extra text is 'GPU', multiple stacked strips clearly imply several requests forming a batch, and that batch feeds a GPU block via a single forward-pass arrow."
