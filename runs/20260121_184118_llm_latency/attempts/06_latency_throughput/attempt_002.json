  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Trade-off Between Latency and Throughput'. Diagram: A scatter plot with many dots (50+). X-axis labeled 'tok/min/GPU', Y-axis labeled 'ms/token'. Trend is upward but noisy. Only text: 'Trade-off Between Latency and Throughput', 'tok/min/GPU', 'ms/token'. Refinements: Remove the arrow glyph from the x-axis label so the only text there is exactly 'tok/min/GPU'.; Keep all other visual elements (scatter, trend bands, colors, title placement) as they are, since they match the requested style and content..",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Trade-off Between Latency and Throughput'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Scatter plot has many points and a noisy upward trend.",
    "Axes are labeled 'tok/min/GPU' and 'ms/token'."

  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.8,
    "failures": [
      "X-axis label includes an arrow glyph at the axis end, violating the requirement that the only text there be exactly 'tok/min/GPU'."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Remove the arrow marker from the end of the x-axis so the only visible text near that axis is exactly 'tok/min/GPU'. Keep the scatter, trend bands, colors, and layout unchanged."
    ],
    "summary": "Most rubric items are satisfied: clean corporate technical style, correct title text, only the specified textual labels, and a noisy upward-trending scatter plot with correctly labeled axes. However, the x-axis still ends in an arrow glyph, which conflicts with the refinement that the x-axis label text must be exactly 'tok/min/GPU' with no arrow. Removing that arrow would make the slide fully compliant."
