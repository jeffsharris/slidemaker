  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Trade-off Between Latency and Throughput'. Diagram: A scatter plot with many dots (50+). X-axis labeled 'tok/min/GPU', Y-axis labeled 'ms/token'. Trend is upward but noisy. Only text: 'Trade-off Between Latency and Throughput', 'tok/min/GPU', 'ms/token'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Trade-off Between Latency and Throughput'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Scatter plot has many points and a noisy upward trend.",
    "Axes are labeled 'tok/min/GPU' and 'ms/token'."

      "X-axis label includes an extra arrow symbol not specified in the prompt ('tok/min/GPU \u2192' instead of exactly 'tok/min/GPU')."

    "improvements": [
      "Remove the arrow glyph from the x-axis label so the only text there is exactly 'tok/min/GPU'.",

    "summary": "Visual style, title text, scatter plot density/trend, and axis naming are all correct, but the x-axis label contains an extra arrow character, violating the 'no extra text' requirement."
