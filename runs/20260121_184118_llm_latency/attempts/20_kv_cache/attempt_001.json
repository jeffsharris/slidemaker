Diagram: A KV cache block with reuse arrows and a small dimmed eviction bin labeled 'evict'. Only text: 'KV cache', 'evict'.",

      "Deadpan humor aspect is minimal; consider a slightly more ironically formal or exaggeratedly serious visual touch (while staying text-free) to better read as \u2018deadpan\u2019 rather than purely neutral corporate.",
      "Eviction bin could be even more visually de-emphasized (e.g., lighter opacity or smaller size) to further contrast with the bold reuse arrows and central KV block."
