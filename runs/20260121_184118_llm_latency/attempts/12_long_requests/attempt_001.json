  "prompt": "Playful, cute vector illustration with rounded shapes and soft shadows, pastel palette (mint, coral, sky blue, sunny yellow) on off-white background. Big central illustration, minimal text. Title text in top-left: 'Long requests'. No logos or brand names. Split scene: left shows wide cars/trucks struggling to fit, right shows a rising curve labeled 'cost'.",

    "Batching difficulty is shown with wide cars.",
    "A rising cost curve is visible.",
    "Title 'Long requests' is visible.",

    "improvements": [
      "Cars and trucks could be drawn even wider or more exaggerated to emphasize batching difficulty more clearly.",
      "Consider labeling the left scene with a small caption like 'hard to batch' to explicitly tie cars to the concept, while still keeping text minimal.",
      "You might soften the gridlines on the cost chart slightly to lean even more into the minimal, playful aesthetic."

    "summary": "All rubric items are satisfied: the left side shows wide vehicles squeezed into a narrow lane (batching difficulty), the right side shows a clear rising cost curve labeled 'cost', the title 'Long requests' is visible in the top-left, and the illustration uses a playful, minimal vector style with pastel colors and soft shapes."
