  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' at center. Two request queues feed it: a long queue on the left and a short queue on the right. A plus sign between the queues indicates added capacity. No second server. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Two request queues of different length feed the same server (one longer, one shorter).",
    "A plus sign indicates added capacity."
  ],
  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.5,
    "failures": [
      "No extra text beyond the specified labels: The slide includes additional text 'Long queue' and 'Short queue', which violates the requirement that only 'Capacity' and 'server' appear.",
      "Two request queues feed the same server with a plus sign between the queues: The plus sign is located below the server rather than between the long and short queues, so it does not clearly indicate added capacity between the queues as specified."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Remove the labels 'Long queue' and 'Short queue' so that the only text on the slide is 'Capacity' (title) and 'server' (on the chassis).",
      "Reposition the plus sign so it is visually between the long queue on the left and the short queue on the right, clearly indicating added capacity between the two queues.",
      "Keep the existing clean, technical diagram style, single server chassis, and two differently sized queues feeding that same server, as these aspects already match the prompt."
    ],
    "summary": "The visual style, title text, single labeled server, and two queues are correct, but the slide fails because it introduces extra text ('Long queue', 'Short queue') and places the plus sign below the server rather than between the two queues to indicate added capacity."
