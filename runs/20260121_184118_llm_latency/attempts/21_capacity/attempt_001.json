  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' with a visible GPU bay. Show a plus sign adding extra GPUs inside the SAME chassis, not a second server. A queue of request strips feeds the chassis; the queue is visibly shorter after the added GPUs within the same diagram. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Additional GPUs are shown added inside the same chassis.",
    "The queue becomes shorter after the GPUs are added."

  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.5,
    "failures": [
      "Diagram shows two separate chassis units (a server plus a separate GPU expansion box) instead of additional GPUs clearly added inside the same single chassis.",
      "The GPU bay is not clearly visible as an internal addition within the labeled server chassis; instead, it appears as a distinct second device.",
      "The queue of request strips is positioned before the first chassis and after the second chassis, implying processing by a chain of devices rather than a single chassis with upgraded internal GPUs."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Redraw the diagram so there is only one physical server chassis pictured; show its interior GPU bay clearly, then depict additional GPUs being added inside that same chassis (e.g., more GPU cards/racks within the same outline).",
      "Remove the separate second box; instead, use a zoom-in or before/after internal view of the same chassis to convey additional GPUs being installed.",
      "Ensure the request queue enters and exits the same single chassis, with a visibly longer queue before and a shorter queue after the GPU upgrade, all within one integrated diagram flow."
    ],
    "summary": "Styling, title text, and label constraints are correct, but the illustration incorrectly uses two chassis rather than a single server with added internal GPUs, and the queue change is tied to this two-device layout."
