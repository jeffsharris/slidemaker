  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' with a visible GPU bay. Show a plus sign adding extra GPUs inside the SAME chassis, not a second server. A queue of request strips feeds the chassis; the queue is visibly shorter after the added GPUs within the same diagram. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Additional GPUs are shown added inside the same chassis.",
    "The queue becomes shorter after the GPUs are added."

      "Diagram shows two separate server chassis instead of a single chassis with added GPUs inside the same unit.",
      "Queue is depicted as separate input (left) and output (right) rather than a single queue that is visibly shorter after GPUs are added within one diagram.",
      "Diagram uses a plus sign between two servers rather than a plus sign adding GPUs inside the same chassis."

    "improvements": [
      "Redraw the central diagram to show only one server chassis labeled 'server', with an internal GPU bay where additional GPUs are added; the plus sign should visually indicate adding GPUs inside that single chassis, not adding another server.",
      "Represent the request queue as one contiguous queue feeding the server, and in the same scene show that queue shorter after the GPUs are added (e.g., a before/after segment around the same server) instead of separate left/right flows.",
      "Remove the second server illustration so there is exactly one chassis on the slide, and keep the existing clean, technical style, colors, and deadpan layout."
    ],
    "summary": "Styling and text are correct, but the concept is misrepresented: it shows adding a second server rather than adding GPUs inside the same chassis, and the queue shortening is not clearly a before/after on a single server."
