  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' at center. Two request queues feed it: a long queue on the left and a short queue on the right. A plus sign between the queues indicates added capacity. No second server. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Two request queues of different length feed the same server (one longer, one shorter).",
    "A plus sign indicates added capacity."
  ],
  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.5,
    "failures": [
      "No plus sign is present between the two queues to indicate added capacity.",
      "Only one request queue is clearly feeding the server; the second (short) queue is depicted on the output side of the server instead of also feeding into it.",
      "Arrows show flow from the long queue to the server and from the server to the short queue, rather than two queues both feeding the same server as specified."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Add a visible plus sign between the long and short queues, positioned so it clearly indicates added capacity between the two queues.",
      "Rearrange the diagram so that both the long and short queues are on the input side of the server and clearly feed into the same server chassis (both with inbound arrows).",
      "Remove or adjust the right-side arrow so it does not imply the short queue is an output; instead, use arrows from each queue toward the central server."
    ],
    "summary": "Styling, title text, and server labeling are correct, but the required capacity concept is not: both queues must feed the same server with a plus sign between them, which is missing and misarranged here."
