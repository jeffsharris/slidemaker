  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' with a visible GPU bay. Show a plus sign adding extra GPUs inside the SAME chassis, not a second server. A queue of request strips feeds the chassis; the queue is visibly shorter after the added GPUs within the same diagram. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Additional GPUs are shown added inside the same chassis.",
    "The queue becomes shorter after the GPUs are added."

  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.4,
    "failures": [
      "Diagram shows two separate server chassis in the lower section instead of a single chassis with added GPUs.",
      "The plus sign is used between two servers, not to show GPUs added inside the same chassis.",
      "The queue appears both before the first server and after the second server; it is not a single queue that is visibly shorter after GPUs are added within one diagrammed server.",
      "Overall layout suggests scaling by adding another server rather than expanding GPU capacity in one chassis, contrary to the prompt."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Redraw the lower diagram to show exactly one server chassis, with the GPU bay visibly expanded to include additional GPUs inside the same chassis.",
      "Place the plus sign inside or directly on the GPU bay to clearly indicate added GPUs, not added servers.",
      "Use a single queue of request strips feeding the server; show it longer before GPU addition and shorter afterward within the same unified diagram sequence.",
      "Remove the duplicate second server; keep exactly one chassis labeled 'server' throughout the slide while still showing the before/after capacity change, e.g., via ghosted overlays or a two-stage GPU bay within the same unit."
    ],
    "summary": "Style, title text, and labels are correct, but the diagram incorrectly adds a second server chassis instead of additional GPUs inside one chassis, and the queue shortening is not clearly represented per the specification."
