  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' with a visible GPU bay. Show a plus sign adding extra GPUs inside the SAME chassis, not a second server. A queue of request strips feeds the chassis; the queue is visibly shorter after the added GPUs within the same diagram. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'. Refinements: Redraw the diagram to feature only one server chassis labeled 'server'.; Depict additional GPUs being added inside that same single chassis, using a plus sign that clearly connects the GPUs to the chassis interior rather than to another server.; Show a single request queue feeding the same chassis, rendered longer on the left (before GPUs) and shorter on the right (after GPUs) without introducing a second server image..",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Additional GPUs are shown added inside the same chassis.",
    "The queue becomes shorter after the GPUs are added."

    "failures": [
      "Diagram shows two separate server chassis instead of exactly one.",
      "Additional GPUs are depicted in a second server, not clearly added inside the same single chassis.",

    "improvements": [
      "Redraw the diagram to contain only one server chassis, labeled 'server'. Remove the second chassis entirely.",
      "Place the plus sign so it clearly indicates additional GPUs being inserted inside the interior of that single chassis (e.g., GPUs outside with a plus leading into open slots in the same box).",
      "Render a single request queue feeding the chassis, with a longer queue before the GPU addition and a visibly shorter queue segment after the GPUs, all in one continuous diagram without adding another server image.",
      "Maintain the existing clean, deadpan corporate technical style, color palette, and minimal text while applying these structural changes."
    ],
    "summary": "Styling, title, and text usage are correct, but the diagram fails the core structural requirements: it shows two servers instead of one, does not clearly add GPUs inside a single chassis, and omits a shorter post-upgrade queue."
