  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' with a visible GPU bay. Show a plus sign adding extra GPUs inside the SAME chassis, not a second server. A queue of request strips feeds the chassis; the queue is visibly shorter after the added GPUs within the same diagram. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Additional GPUs are shown added inside the same chassis.",
    "The queue becomes shorter after the GPUs are added."
  ],
  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.5,
    "failures": [
      "The diagram shows two separate server chassis instead of exactly one chassis as required.",
      "The GPUs appear in a second server rather than being visibly added inside the same single chassis.",
      "The queue shortening is depicted on the right side of a second server, not as a before/after state of a single server chassis."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Redraw the diagram to feature only one server chassis in the slide, labeled 'server'.",
      "Depict the GPUs being added inside that same chassis; for example, show a left half with fewer GPUs and a right half of the same chassis with more GPUs, or use an internal plus sign indicating added GPUs without duplicating the chassis.",
      "Show the request queue longer before the GPUs are added and clearly shorter afterward, both feeding into the same single chassis rather than two separate servers."
    ],
    "summary": "The style, title, and text labeling are correct, but the diagram uses two servers instead of a single chassis gaining additional GPUs, and the queue change is tied to that second server rather than a before/after state of one server."
