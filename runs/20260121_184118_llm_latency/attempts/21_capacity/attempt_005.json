  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' with a visible GPU bay. Show a plus sign adding extra GPUs inside the SAME chassis, not a second server. A queue of request strips feeds the chassis; the queue is visibly shorter after the added GPUs within the same diagram. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Additional GPUs are shown added inside the same chassis.",
    "The queue becomes shorter after the GPUs are added."

    "improvements": [
      "Show only a single server chassis in the diagram rather than two separate chassis; illustrate the before/after state within the same physical server outline so there is clearly only one server labeled 'server'.",
      "Depict GPUs visibly added to the GPU bay inside that same single chassis (e.g., more GPU cards appearing in the same bay rather than a new server on the right).",
      "Make the request queue clearly shorter after the GPUs are added; for example, show a taller stack of request strips feeding the initial configuration and a noticeably smaller stack feeding the upgraded configuration, all within one continuous diagram so the reduction is unambiguous."
    ],
    "summary": "The style, title, and text constraints are met, but the slide shows two separate server chassis rather than a single chassis with added GPUs, and it does not clearly depict a shorter queue after GPU expansion within the same server."
