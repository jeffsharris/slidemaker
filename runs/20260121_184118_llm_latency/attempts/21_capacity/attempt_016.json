  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' with a visible GPU bay. Show a plus sign adding extra GPUs inside the SAME chassis, not a second server. A queue of request strips feeds the chassis; the queue is visibly shorter after the added GPUs within the same diagram. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Additional GPUs are shown added inside the same chassis.",
    "The queue becomes shorter after the GPUs are added."
  ],
  "grade": {
    "pass": false,
    "score": 0.33,
    "failures": [
      "More than one server chassis is shown; the rubric requires exactly one chassis.",
      "The added GPUs are depicted in a second server, not inside the same chassis.",
      "The queue is shown twice as separate queues for two servers rather than a single queue that becomes visibly shorter after adding GPUs within one diagram.",
      "The diagram conceptually suggests adding another server instead of adding GPUs to the same chassis."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Redraw the diagram with only a single server chassis in the slide, labeled 'server'.",
      "Show the chassis once, with a visible GPU bay, and depict additional GPUs being added inside that same bay (e.g., more GPU cards in the same row).",
      "Use a single queue of request strips entering the server; in the same visual, indicate the queue becoming shorter after GPUs are added (e.g., before/after within the same chassis or with a ghosted overlay).",
      "Remove the second server and ensure the plus sign refers to adding GPUs within the chassis, not to an additional server."
    ],
    "summary": "The slide meets the title, text, and stylistic intent but fails key structural requirements: it shows two servers and treats capacity as adding another server instead of adding GPUs within one chassis and shortening a single queue accordingly."
