  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' at center. Two request queues feed it: a long queue on the left and a short queue on the right. A plus sign between the queues indicates added capacity. No second server. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.",
  "rubric": [
    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Capacity'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Exactly one server chassis is shown and it is labeled 'server'.",
    "Two request queues of different length feed the same server (one longer, one shorter).",
    "A plus sign indicates added capacity."

      "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
      "Two request queues of different length feed the same server (one longer, one shorter)."

    "improvements": [
      "Remove all arrow glyphs and any other non-specified textual/character markings so that only the words 'Capacity' and 'server' appear on the slide.",
      "Redraw the right-hand side so that it is clearly a second request queue feeding into the same server (visually similar style to the left queue but shorter, positioned as an input rather than output)."
    ],
    "summary": "The style, title text, single server labeled 'server', and plus sign are correct. However, there are arrow glyphs that count as extra text/characters beyond the specified labels, and the right-hand blocks are shown as an output queue rather than a second input queue feeding the server."
