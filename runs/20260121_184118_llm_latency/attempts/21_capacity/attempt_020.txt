Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Capacity'. Diagram: ONE server chassis labeled 'server' at center with a clear plus sign attached to the chassis. A short queue of 3 request strips feeds the server in the foreground. Behind it, a faint ghosted longer queue of 8 strips shows the before state. No labels near queues. No second server. Only text: 'Capacity', 'server'.
