  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Routing'. Diagram: A simplified world map with multiple data center nodes connected by network lines. A request arrow chooses between two distant clusters. Only text: 'Routing'.",

    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",

    "improvements": [
      "Push the deadpan humor slightly further, e.g., through a subtly exaggeratedly neat layout or very understated visual gag that still fits a corporate style.",
