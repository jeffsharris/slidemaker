  "prompt": "Playful, cute vector illustration with rounded shapes and soft shadows, pastel palette (mint, coral, sky blue, sunny yellow) on off-white background. Big central illustration, minimal text. Title text in top-left: 'Input vs output'. No logos or brand names. Two horizontal lanes: top 'input' with small cheap token pills, bottom 'output' with larger expensive pills and a longer time bar.",
  "rubric": [
    "Input and output are labeled.",
    "Output appears more expensive or slower.",
    "Title 'Input vs output' is visible.",
    "Playful, clear composition."

  "grade": {
    "pass": true,
    "score": 9.5,
    "failures": [],
    "improvements": [
      "To emphasize that output is slower, exaggerate the time bar difference further (e.g., make the top bar clearly shorter and lighter, the bottom bar much longer and fully filled).",
      "To make the \u2018more expensive\u2019 idea even clearer, consider subtle visual cues like sparkles, shine, or a tiny coin/icon near the output pills while keeping the composition minimal.",
      "Increase overall centrality of the two lanes (move them slightly closer together and toward the center) so the illustration reads even more obviously as one cohesive \u2018before/after\u2019 comparison."
    ],
    "summary": "All rubric items are met: both lanes are clearly labeled Input and Output, the output lane conveys higher value with larger, more elaborate pills and a heart, the title 'Input vs output' is visible at the top, and the style is playful, pastel, and cleanly composed. Minor tweaks could further stress the slower/more expensive nature of the output."
