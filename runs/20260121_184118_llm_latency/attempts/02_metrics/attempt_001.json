Big central illustration, minimal text. Title text in top-left: 'Metrics'. No logos or brand names. Three friendly icons in a row: stopwatch labeled 'TTFT', metronome labeled 'TBT', and a tiny curve labeled 'p95'. Keep labels short and readable.",

TTFT and TBT labels are clearly visible and legible under their respective icons, a p95 indicator appears as a small curve/graph with the label \u2018p95\u2019, the title \u2018Metrics\u2019 is visible at the top-left, and the overall style is playful, minimal, and uses simple, cute vector icons matching the prompt."
