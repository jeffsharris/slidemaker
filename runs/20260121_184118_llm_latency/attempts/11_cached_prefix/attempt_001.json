  "prompt": "Playful, cute vector illustration with rounded shapes and soft shadows, pastel palette (mint, coral, sky blue, sunny yellow) on off-white background.

A prompt bar split into a bright 'cached' segment with a check icon and a gray 'new' segment.",

      "Increase the brightness or saturation of the green cached segment slightly more to exaggerate the contrast with the gray new segment.",
      "Add a subtle divider line or notch between the cached and new sections of the bar to further clarify the split.",
