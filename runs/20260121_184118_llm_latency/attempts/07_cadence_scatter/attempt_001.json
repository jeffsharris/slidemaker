  "prompt": "Playful, cute vector illustration with rounded shapes and soft shadows, pastel palette (mint, coral, sky blue, sunny yellow) on off-white background. Big central illustration, minimal text. Title text in top-left: 'Cadence'. No logos or brand names. A simple scatter plot with short axis labels: x='tok/min/GPU', y='ms/token'. Dots form an upward trend. Keep grid minimal.",

    "Scatter plot with labeled axes appears.",
    "Axis labels are short and legible.",

      "Scatter plot is present and clear, but you could slightly increase axis label font size to enhance legibility at a distance.",

    "summary": "All rubric items are satisfied: there is a scatter plot with labeled axes ('ms/token' and 'tok/min/GPU'), the axis labels are short and readable, the dots form a clear upward trend, and the title 'Cadence' appears prominently at the top-left."
