  "prompt": "Deadpan corporate technical diagram, clean vector lines, subtle shadows, off-white background, muted slate + graphite with cyan and safety orange accents. Big central diagram, consistent title placement top-left. Only include the exact text specified. No other text or numbers. Title text in top-left: 'Why output dominates'. Diagram: A short input block goes through one compute block once. Then a long chain of output tokens each passes through repeated identical compute blocks, showing sequential steps. Only text: 'Why output dominates'. Refinements: Remove the 'Input' label so the only text on the slide is the title 'Why output dominates'.; Ensure the title text remains exactly 'Why output dominates' and is clearly positioned in the top-left corner consistent with the style guidelines.; Keep using icons/shapes for input, compute, and output tokens, but avoid any textual annotations or labels within or near the diagram in future iterations..",

    "The slide uses a clean, technical diagram style with deadpan humor.",
    "Title text reads exactly 'Why output dominates'.",
    "No extra text appears beyond the specified labels.",
    "Output tokens are shown going through repeated compute blocks sequentially.",
    "Input appears processed once while output repeats many steps."

      "To emphasize the contrast between single input processing and many output steps even more, you could slightly shorten the input side further or visually group the repeated output segments (e.g., subtle bracket or spacing) while keeping it text-free.",
      "Increase the sense of deadpan humor by pushing the disproportion a bit further\u2014add one or two more repeated compute/output segments to make the imbalance more visually absurd without adding text.",
      "Consider slightly increasing the visual prominence (size or subtle glow) of the first compute block vs. the repeated ones to clarify that input only traverses a single main compute step, while outputs keep repeating the same unit."

    "summary": "All rubric items are met: clean technical diagram with a deadpan feel, exact title text in the top-left, no extra text, and a clear visual story where a single input is processed once and outputs pass through repeated compute blocks sequentially."
