  "prompt": "Playful, cute vector illustration with rounded shapes and soft shadows, pastel palette (mint, coral, sky blue, sunny yellow) on off-white background. Big central illustration, minimal text. Title text in top-left: 'Wafer'. No logos or brand names. A single huge wafer-scale chip replaces many small chips, with a fast arrow and tiny tokens flowing quickly.",
  "rubric": [
    "A single giant wafer-scale chip is shown.",
    "Speed improvement is implied.",
    "Title 'Wafer' is visible.",
    "Playful, minimal style."

      "The speed implication is present via the large arrow and flowing tokens, but could be made even clearer with motion lines or a clearer contrast between the slow many-chips side and the fast wafer side.",
      "The smaller chips on the left could be slightly more visually separated from the central wafer so the contrast of 'many small vs one big' is immediately obvious at a glance.",
      "Text for the title 'Wafer' could be nudged slightly closer to the top-left corner to adhere more literally to the prompt\u2019s placement request. The current position is close but not perfectly anchored."
    ],
    "summary": "All rubric items are met: a single giant wafer-scale chip is central, speed improvement is implied by the fast arrow and flowing tokens, the title 'Wafer' is clearly visible, and the style is playful, cute, and minimal."
